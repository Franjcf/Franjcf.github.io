description: In this project I succesufully implemented the transformer outlined in the landmark paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et. al., 2017 into TensorFlow for language translation from English to Portuguese. This time however, I made it possible to configure the transformer with differing amount of encoder and decoder layers, making it a more flexible configuration.
