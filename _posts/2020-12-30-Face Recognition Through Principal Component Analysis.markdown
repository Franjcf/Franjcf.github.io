description: 'Face recognition is an ubiquitous feature within our technological landscape: it is used within our phones, photo applications, internet communications, and even self-maneuvering machines. However, images are notoriously information-heavy, leading to slow algorithms and large data repositories. In this mini-project, I investigate the application of Singular Value Decomposition and Principal Component Analysis into the area of facial recognition. The results are fairly intuitive: the accuracy of a face recognition algorithm increases as we increase the number of principal components we use to represent a given image. However, this correlation is non-monotonic, leading to quick diminishing returns in accuracy as we get to use around principal 100 components. Therefore, it abundantly clear that we can use PCA to optimize our face-classification algorithms'
