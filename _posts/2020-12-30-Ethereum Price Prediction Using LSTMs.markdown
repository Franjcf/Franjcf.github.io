description:!'Ethereum is a blockchain-based network used for the creation and execution of "smart contracts". These special contracts can be used for a wide range of applications:  from confirming basic cryptocurrency transactions (lending, payments, ext...), the creation on "Non-Fungible Tokens", to the implementation of Decentralized Finance networks. Unfortunately, this network is mostly known for the ample speculation related to its native cryptocurrency "Ether". This has led to wide swings in its price and high volatility. In this project I use Long short-term memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to try and predict the price of Ether as a function of previous prices and sentiment analysis based on crowd sentiment on "Reddit" (a social media platform). The use of LSTM's allows for the neural network to maintain a "memory" of relevant past events in an effort to increase prediction accuracy.'
